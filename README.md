# Smart HVAC project

Semester long project for ISU's CPR E 287x course. Students designed and implemented an inteligent home HVAC system utilizing the MQTT network protocol to communicate between 5 seperated control nodes. Includes both a simulation mode which can be ran on a single machine, and code to be deployed to a physical model of a residential home.

To run on desktop Python, set node_type to NODE_TYPE_SIMULATED in node_config.py.

Use deploy.sh to deploy to hardware nodes.
